# mvscomplete layout for AttractMode front end

by Keil Miller Jr [Keil Miller Jr](http://keilmillerjr.com)

![Image of layout](layout.gif)

## DESCRIPTION:

*mvscomplete* is a layout for the [AttractMode](http://attractmode.org) front end. It was designed because I was seeking a better option than the 161-in-1 multicart for the neo geo. The 161-in-1 multicart has an awful menu, missing games, and a bunch of hacks.

This layout is intended to be displayed at a minimum of VGA resolution (640x480) and will scale gracefully to any higher resolutions, including widescreen resolutions.

## Requirements:

* AttractMode compatible device with AttractMode 2.3.0 or greater installed
* Mame/GroovyMame installed with corresponding neogeo roms and bios (to run neo geo games)

## Paths

You may need to change file paths as necessary if your differs.

## Install Files

1. Copy layout files to ```$HOME/Apps/AttractModeFE/layouts/mvscomplete/```
2. Copy the contents of ```snap/``` to your snap artwork folder. You may copy and rename these files to match your displays. They will be used as default for missing artwork.
3. The [Helpers module](https://github.com/keilmillerjr/helpers-module) is **REQUIRED** for you to install. The layout will not work correctly without it.
4. The [Shuffle module](https://github.com/keilmillerjr/shuffle-module) is **REQUIRED** for you to install. The layout will not work correctly without it.

## Optional Files

1. The [Shader module](https://github.com/keilmillerjr/shader-module) is **RECOMMENDED**. Shader module is required if you intend to use crt shaders within the layout, or have round corners on the slot artwork.
2. The [Leap plugin](https://github.com/keilmillerjr/leap-plugin) is **OPTIONAL**. Leap plugin helps to leap over empty filters. Whacky things happen if you have a favorites filter and no roms selected as a favorite!
3. The [FadeToGame plugin](https://github.com/keilmillerjr/fadetogame-plugin) is **OPTIONAL**. FadeToGame will fade the screen when transitioning to and from a game. Be sure to set "To Game Run Time" to at least *2064 milliseconds* if using SoundFx in mvscomplete, to prevent clipping of select SoundFx.

## Config

* Edit the following files to somewhat match below, or you may use the config menu (tab) inside AttractMode to enter the values. Do not forget to generate the rom index and history index from the config menu.

File: ```$HOME/Apps/AttractModeFE/attract.cfg```

Artwork for this theme in particular is recommended to be obtained from the following:

* Marquee: [PleasureDome](https://www.pleasuredome.org.uk) -> MAME 0.192 EXTRAs -> artwork -> romname.zip -> romname.png
